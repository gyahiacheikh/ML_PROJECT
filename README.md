# Obesity Level Estimation Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on a multi-class obesity level classification task using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict obesity categories based on individuals’ eating habits, physical condition, and lifestyle features, while systematically comparing different modeling approaches in terms of performance, robustness, and interpretability.

The workflow covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble learning. Multiple classifiers are implemented, including statistical, probabilistic, margin-based, and tree-based models, culminating in ensemble methods to improve predictive stability and accuracy.
